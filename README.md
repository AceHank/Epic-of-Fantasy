# Epic-of-Fantasy
This is a mod that adds fantasy races and civilizations into the Gods & Kings. It's not balanced around vanilla civs but around itself. See civilopedia for details on each nations.
Playing with [Only Mod Civilization](https://github.com/amfauzn/Only-Mod-Civilizations) by [amfauzn](https://github.com/amfauzn) is highly recommended.

Inspired from popular fantasy lore, DnD, LotR, Warcraft, Warhammer, SCP, and many more!

For modders: If you want to use the assets from this sprite, you can contact me on Unciv Discord Server! I opted to remove them from this repository to reduce mod size!

*This mod uses AI Generated content.
